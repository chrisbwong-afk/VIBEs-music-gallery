# Personal Music Gallery & Player 

This page was something I wanted to do to store my projects in a place that wasn't Soundtrap. I DO NOT own the tracks or vocals in these songs, I only took some songs I liked and reimagined them. I aimed to have fun in doing this and that was accomplished. 

## Thumbnails
Same thing, I do not own any of the images or thumbnails, they only help identify the sum of the parts.

## Features

### Player

The player has a display thumbnail, skip and rewind controls, and progress display. Clicking on the player thumbnail can pause and play the song. If not using the mouse, there are keyboard controls:
<ul>
<li>Space to pause or play </li>
<li>"Q" to rewind 10 seconds</li>
<li>"E" to skip 10 seconds</li>
<li>"W" to return to the top of the page</li>
<li>"S" for shuffle </li>
<li>"D" for loop </li> 
<li>"A" for auto</li>
<li>"0-9" to skip to the corresponding percentage of the song</li>
<li>"Z" and "X" to adjust the volume</li>
</ul>

### Song Bank

Below the player is a library of every song that is in the repo, and the thumbnails have cursor reactive behaviour. The active song itself becomes visually larger than other thumbnails, and has a slight opacity change.

The bank itself is built from a self updating json file. When a new song and thumbnail are pushed to Github, its data is automatically entered into the json and the bank reflects this entry.

### Shuffle

The shuffle button picks a random song from the bank and plays it. 

### Loop & Auto

Loop and auto behave as expected, and are off by default, with text updates for when they are on.
